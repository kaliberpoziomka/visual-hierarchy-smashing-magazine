This project showed me how important Visual Hierarchy is.
The hardest part of planning heat map layout was understand how user's eyes are exploring the web page.
In case of Smashing Magazine home page I think it is Z-Pattern.

Thanks to this project I learned how to compose pictures with headers and paragraphs using visual hierarchy rules.
